Overview :triangular_ruler:

The initial phase of the AirBnB project at Holberton School commences with the implementation of the console segment. This phase serves as a foundation for comprehending essential principles of advanced programming. The overarching ambition of the AirBnB project is to eventually launch a basic replication of the AirBnB Website (HBnB) on our server. The console module is crafted during this stage to effectively manage entities associated with the AirBnB (HBnB) website.

This marks the inception of our journey towards creating a comprehensive web application: the AirBnB clone.

A command interpreter is engineered to facilitate the administration of objects within our Airbnb clone:

    Introduce new entities (e.g., Users or Places)
    Retrieve entities from files, databases, etc.
    Execute operations on entities (e.g., counting, statistical computations, etc.)
    Modify attributes of entities
    Eradicate entities



    Clone this repository: git clone "https://github.com/LauraYarda/AirBnB_clone.git"
    Access the AirBnB directory: cd AirBnB_clone
    Interactively run hbnb: ./console and input commands
    Run hbnb non-interactively: echo "<command>" | ./console.py
